UnPack is a minimal layer on top of vim.pack API to allow single file plugin configurations.


  [!IMPORTANT]
  `vim.pack` is currently under development in the `neovim-nightly` branch.

INSTALLATION                                   *unpack.nvim-nvim-installation*

Add these lines to your init.lua:

>lua
    local unpack_path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/site/pack/managers/start/unpack"
    
    if not vim.uv.fs_stat(unpack_path) then
        vim.fn.system({
            "git",
            "clone",
            "--filter=blob:none",
            "https://github.com/mezdelex/unpack.nvim",
            unpack_path,
        })
    end
    vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend(unpack_path)
    
    require("unpack").setup()
<


SETUP                                                 *unpack.nvim-nvim-setup*

Available options:

>lua
    ---@class UnPack.Config.UserOpts
    --- Options for vim.pack.add
    ---@field add_options? vim.pack.keyset.add
    --- Options for vim.pack.update
    ---@field update_options? vim.pack.keyset.update
<

Call setup right after the installation with your preferred options if you
don’t like the defaults.


  [!TIP]
  Make sure you set `vim.g.mapleader` beforehand.
>lua
    require("unpack").setup({
        ...
    })
<

Defaults are set with minimal interaction in mind. If you want to be notified
about all the changes, set `confirm` to true and `force` to false. See
|vim.pack|


SPEC                                                   *unpack.nvim-nvim-spec*

This layer extends `vim.pack.Spec` to allow single file configurations.

>lua
    ---@class UnPack.Spec : vim.pack.Spec
    ---@field config? fun()
    ---@field defer? boolean
    ---@field dependencies? UnPack.Spec[]
<

It also leverages `PackChanged` event triggered by `vim.pack` internals to run
plugin build hooks. The same `command` that is fired inside the event is
provided as a standalone one. See `Commands` section.

Example plugin spec setups under `/lua/plugins/`:

>lua
    return {
        config = function()
            ...
        end,
        data = { build = "your build --command" },
        defer = true,
        src = "https://github.com/<vendor>/plugin1",
    }
<

>lua
    return {
        config = function()
            ...
        end,
        data = {
            build = "your build --command",
            conflicts = { "conflicting_file_name1.dll", "conflicting_file_name2.dll" }
        },
        defer = true,
        src = "https://github.com/<vendor>/plugin1",
    }
<

>lua
    return {
        config = function()
            ...
        end,
        defer = true,
        dependencies = {
            {
                defer = true,
                src = "https://github.com/<vendor>/plugin2",
            },
        },
        src = "https://github.com/<vendor>/plugin3",
    }
<


BUILD ~

UnPack expects a `build` field inside `data` table for the build hook, so make
sure you add it like shown in the first example. This is because `vim.pack`
handles the event trigger internally and exposes `vim.pack.Spec`, not the
extended one, so we need to rely on that table. The build hook is planned to be
part of and handled by the plugin itself, that’s why there’s no build hook
exposed on purpose, but for now this is the workaround.

For reference, this is the `autocmd` that listens to the event triggered by
`vim.pack` internals whenever there’s a change in any package.


  [!NOTE]
  This is already set, you don’t need to worry about it.
>lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_augroup(group, { clear = true })
    
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("PackChanged", {
        callback = function(args)
            local kind = args.data.kind ---@type string
    
            if kind == "install" or kind == "update" then
                local spec = args.data.spec ---@type UnPack.Spec
    
                commands.build({ spec })
            end
        end,
        group = group,
    })
<


CONFLICTS ~

Under WinOS, there are some permission problems related to the write rights on
locked files and this affects the build hook when updating some plugins like
`blink.cmp`. To address this, together with the `build` hook, `UnPack` expects
you to use `conflicts` hook inside the `data` table. This is like this because
the `build` hook will eventually be handled by the plugin itself with the
incoming `spec` changes as we stated before, so it makes sense to keep them
together.

Until then, this is the workaround for WinOS users:

>lua
    return {
        config = function()
            -- example configuration
            require("blink.cmp").setup({
                completion = {
                    documentation = { auto_show = true },
                },
                keymap = { preset = "enter" },
            })
        end,
        data = {
            build = "cargo build --release",
            conflicts = { "blink_cmp_fuzzy.dll" },
        },
        defer = true,
        src = "https://github.com/saghen/blink.cmp",
    }
<


DEFER ~

Every spec marked with `defer = true` is going to be deferred using
`vim.schedule` to avoid UI render delay. Dependencies follow the same rules.


DEPENDENCIES ~

The dependencies handling logic is pretty simple: the plugins are going to be
loaded in order, so make sure to add the dependencies in order too. For
example, if any of your plugins relies on `plenary` as a dependency, add it in
the first plugin that requires it following your `plugins` directory name
order, and that’s pretty much it.


COMMANDS                                           *unpack.nvim-nvim-commands*


  [!NOTE]
  All the notifications are wrapped in a `vim.schedule` call to avoid command
  line overflow. If you want to see the recap after executing any command, use
  `:messages`.
The commands provided are:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command      Description
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------
  PackBuild    Iterates over all the plugin specs and runs all the build hooks.
               (Triggered automatically on PackChanged event per changed
               package)

  PackClean    Removes any plugin present in your packages directory that
               doesn’t exist as a plugin spec and cleans stale conflicts if any.

  PackLoad     Loads all the plugins in your plugins directory. (Runs on
               VimEnter; exposed for build timeouts)

  PackPull     Updates UnPack to the latest version. (Runs on VimEnter; calls
               vim.system asynchronously to pull changes)

  PackUpdate   Updates all the plugins present in your packages directory.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can also use them this way if you prefer:

>lua
        local commands = require("unpack.commands")
    
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<your-keymap>", commands.build)
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<your-keymap>", commands.clean)
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<your-keymap>", commands.load)
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<your-keymap>", commands.pull)
        vim.keymap.set("n", "<your-keymap>", commands.update)
